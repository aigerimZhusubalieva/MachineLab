3  THEMES FOR THE CLASS CLOCK
1. NYU Abu Dhabi - make a clock that represents the 4-year cycle that students go through. The storyline goes from admissions/Marhaba through studyaways, J-terms, and other components of the NYUAD experience, and ends with commencement. We can incorporate a lot of different references to the campus such as the palms, d2, flights, the library, etc.
2. Astronomy/Space - create a clock with many different astronomical references such as the constellations, the planets, the satellites, and different space exploration components. We can have the first moon landing as one of the historical moments to represent in the clock.
3. Disco - make the clock very unserious and shiny, disco-inspired with a big disco ball and a lot of light and musical elements.
